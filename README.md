# Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook

# Usage
1. Open the object_tracking.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions and comments provided in the notebook to understand each step of the process.
3. Execute each code cell in sequence by pressing Shift + Enter.
4. Modify the code as needed to adapt it to your own video input or use case.

# Object Tracking Methods
The notebook provides examples of how to use various object tracking methods available in the OpenCV library, such as:
1. BOOSTING
2. MIL
3. KCF
4. TLD
5. MEDIANFLOW
6. MOSSE
7. CSRT
You can experiment with different tracking methods to find the one that works best for your specific use case.

# Video Input
This notebook assumes that you have a video file available for object tracking. You will need to provide the path to your video file in the code. The notebook also includes code for capturing video from a webcam if you prefer to use live video input.

# Tracking Process
The notebook demonstrates the following steps for implementing object tracking:

1. Initialize the video capture and tracker.
2. Read the first frame of the video.
3. Select the object to track using a bounding box.
4. Update the tracker with each new frame and draw the bounding box around the tracked object.
5. Display the video with the tracked object and save the output (optional).
